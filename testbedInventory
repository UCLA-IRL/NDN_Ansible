# We need to get link costs for neighbors from somewhere but we want to make
# sure that the cost is same for both endpoints. i.e. the WU/MEMPHIS link should
# have the same cost on the WU end as on the MEMPHIS end.
# Hyperbolic Routing params (hr_radius, hr_angle) need updating
# WU needs extra strategy for ndndemo added in nfd-init.sh

# Everything defined in host_vars/{name}, e.g. host_vars/WU contains all variables for node WU
